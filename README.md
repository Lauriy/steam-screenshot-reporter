I'm mad at Steam

Uses https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet and Django

Fancy project
setup: https://mitelman.engineering/blog/python-best-practice/automating-python-best-practices-for-a-new-project/#fast-track

classifier_model.onnx from https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet/releases/tag/v0

Same for detector_v2_default_checkpoint.onnx if you want it, didn't work for me.

Skip compiling scipy on Windows: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scipy

Generally don't try and get this running on a local venv, use the remote one from docker-compose.

`pre-commit run --all-files`

// Archiving project since Steam seems to have come to their senses
